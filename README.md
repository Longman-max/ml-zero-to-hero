# mlcode

A repository for storing machine learning code examples.

## Overview
This repository contains simple, reproducible examples covering different areas of machine learning.  
It is intended as a reference for learning, experimentation, and demonstration.

## Structure
- `datasets/` – sample datasets for experiments  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks with ML examples  
- `src/` – organized Python scripts for various ML tasks  

## Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Longman-max/mlcode.git
cd mlcode
````

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples

* `src/regression/linear_regression.py` – basic linear regression
* `src/classification/logistic_regression.py` – simple classifier
* `src/clustering/kmeans.py` – clustering example
* `src/deep_learning/neural_net.py` – minimal neural network
